function example() {
    return "Hello, World!";
}
```

# For terminal commands
```bash
npm install package-name
```

### Code Style Guidelines

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Include TypeScript types when applicable
- Add comprehensive comments
- Include error handling
- Use meaningful variable names

```javascript
// Good example
interface User {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
}

async function fetchUser(userId: string): Promise<User | null> {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
        
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`Failed to fetch user: ${response.status}`);
        }
        
        const user: User = await response.json();
        return user;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints
- Include docstrings
- Add error handling
- Use meaningful variable names

```python
from typing import Optional, List

def process_user_data(users: List[dict]) -> Optional[dict]:
    """
    Process a list of user data and return summary statistics.
    
    Args:
        users: List of user dictionaries
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with summary statistics or None if processing fails
    """
    try:
        if not users:
            return None
            
        total_users = len(users)
        active_users = sum(1 for user in users if user.get('active', False))
        
        return {
            'total_users': total_users,
            'active_users': active_users,
            'active_percentage': (active_users / total_users) * 100
        }
    except Exception as error:
        print(f"Error processing user data: {error}")
        return None
```

#### SQL
- Use uppercase for SQL keywords
- Use meaningful table and column names
- Include comments for complex queries
- Format for readability

```sql
-- Good example
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.name,
    u.email,
    COUNT(o.id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.created_at >= '2024-01-01'
  AND u.active = true
GROUP BY u.id, u.name, u.email
HAVING COUNT(o.id) > 0
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```
