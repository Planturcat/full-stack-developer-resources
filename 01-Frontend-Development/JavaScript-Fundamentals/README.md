# JavaScript Fundamentals

This section covers essential JavaScript concepts that form the foundation of modern web development. Each topic includes detailed explanations and practical examples.

## Topics Covered

1. **ES6+ Features** - Modern JavaScript syntax and features
2. **Closures, Hoisting, and Scope** - Understanding JavaScript's execution context
3. **Promises, Async/Await, and Event Loop** - Asynchronous programming patterns
4. **Prototypes and Inheritance** - Object-oriented programming in JavaScript
5. **DOM Manipulation and Event Handling** - Interacting with web pages
6. **Error Handling and Debugging** - Writing robust JavaScript code

## Learning Path

Start with ES6+ features to understand modern syntax, then move through scope and closures to understand how JavaScript executes code. Learn asynchronous programming patterns, then dive into object-oriented concepts. Finally, learn DOM manipulation and error handling for practical web development.
