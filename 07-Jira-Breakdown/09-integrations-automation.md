- **Meeting Notes**: Connect decisions to issues
- **Project Documentation**: Centralized knowledge base

**Setup Process:**
1. Both tools must be in same Atlassian site
2. Integration is automatic for cloud instances
3. Configure application links for server instances

**Common Use Cases:**
```
Epic: User Authentication System
├── Confluence Page: Technical Specification
├── Confluence Page: API Documentation
├── Confluence Page: Security Requirements
└── Confluence Page: Testing Strategy
```

## Automation Rules

### Jira Automation Overview

#### Automation Components
- **Triggers**: Events that start automation
- **Conditions**: Rules that must be met
- **Actions**: What happens when triggered

#### Common Automation Patterns
```
Trigger: Issue Created
Condition: Issue Type = Bug
Action: Set Priority to High, Assign to QA Lead
```

### Creating Automation Rules

#### Rule Creation Process
1. Go to Project Settings → "Automation"
2. Click "Create rule"
3. Configure trigger:
   - **Issue events**: Created, updated, transitioned
   - **Scheduled**: Time-based triggers
   - **Manual**: User-initiated triggers

4. Add conditions (optional):
   - **Field conditions**: Check field values
   - **User conditions**: Check user properties
   - **Date conditions**: Time-based rules

5. Define actions:
   - **Field updates**: Change issue fields
   - **Transitions**: Move through workflow
   - **Notifications**: Send emails or messages
   - **Issue operations**: Create, clone, or link issues

#### Example Automation Rules

**Auto-assign Bugs:**
```
Trigger: Issue Created
Condition: Issue Type = Bug
Action: Assign to QA Lead
```

**Sprint Cleanup:**
```
Trigger: Sprint Completed
Condition: Issue Status != Done
Action: Move to Next Sprint, Add Comment "Moved from previous sprint"
```

**Escalation Rule:**
```
Trigger: Scheduled (Daily)
Condition: Priority = Critical AND Status = Open AND Created > 24h ago
Action: Send Email to Manager, Add Comment "Escalated due to age"
```

**Epic Progress Tracking:**
```
Trigger: Issue Transitioned to Done
Condition: Issue has Epic Link
Action: Update Epic Description with Progress Percentage
```

### Advanced Automation

#### Smart Values
Use dynamic content in automation:

**Common Smart Values:**
- `{{issue.key}}`: Issue identifier
- `{{issue.summary}}`: Issue title
- `{{issue.assignee.displayName}}`: Assignee name
- `{{issue.created}}`: Creation date
- `{{trigger.user.displayName}}`: User who triggered rule

**Example Usage:**
```
Email Subject: Issue {{issue.key}} assigned to you
Email Body: Hi {{issue.assignee.displayName}}, 
           Issue "{{issue.summary}}" has been assigned to you.
           Priority: {{issue.priority.name}}
           Due Date: {{issue.duedate}}
```

#### Conditional Logic
**If/Then/Else Blocks:**
```
IF Priority = Critical
  THEN Assign to Senior Developer
  ELSE Assign to Development Team
```

**Multiple Conditions:**
```
IF Issue Type = Bug AND Priority = High
  THEN Set Fix Version to Next Release
       Send Notification to Product Owner
```

3. **What data needs to sync?**
4. **How often should sync occur?**
5. **What are the security implications?**

#### Integration Strategy
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic integrations
- **User Training**: Ensure team understands new workflows
- **Monitor Usage**: Track adoption and effectiveness
- **Iterate**: Improve based on feedback

### Data Management

#### Sync Considerations
- **Bidirectional vs Unidirectional**: Which direction should data flow?
- **Real-time vs Batch**: How quickly must data sync?
- **Conflict Resolution**: How to handle conflicting updates?
- **Data Mapping**: How do fields correspond between systems?

#### Security and Permissions
- **Authentication**: Secure connection between systems
- **Authorization**: Appropriate access levels
- **Data Privacy**: Protect sensitive information
- **Audit Trail**: Track integration activities

### Troubleshooting Integrations

#### Common Issues
**Sync Failures:**
- Check authentication credentials
- Verify network connectivity
- Review permission settings
- Examine error logs

**Data Inconsistencies:**
- Validate field mappings
- Check for conflicting updates
- Review sync timing
- Verify data formats

**Performance Problems:**
- Monitor sync frequency
- Optimize data queries
- Review system resources
- Consider batch processing

Integrations and automation transform Jira from a standalone tool into the center of your development ecosystem. The final topic covers best practices and optimization strategies.
